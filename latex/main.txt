Introduction

With the deployment of the James Webb Space Telescope, many people are excited to see what discoveries it will uncover about the Universe. Its development has involved bleeding edge technology
and engineering innovations, most of which have the intent to keep the telescope cool. One aspect
of the JWST that is not well understood by most people are Lagrange points and how a satellite can
be positioned in one of these points. High school physics teaches us that satellites can orbit around
stars and planets because of gravity. Yet, when the JWST will orbit around Lagrange point 2, it
appears as if the telescope is orbiting around nothing! How is this possible?
This investigation aims to locate the collinear Sun-Earth Lagrange points and attempt to model the
orbit of a satellite around a Lagrange point using IB level mathematics. Identifying the locations
of the Lagrange points will involve an understanding of algebra and Newtonian mechanics. The
derivation of the halo orbits around the Lagrange points will be more complex, requiring vectors,
calculus, and a bit of linear algebra.

Finding the Lagrange Points

We will be determining the collinear Lagrange points from a rotating frame of reference relative to
a circular orbit of Earth. This simplifies the solution to a single dimension which bisects the Sun
and Earth.

R will be the distance between the Sun and Earth, while r will be the distance from the main body
to the Lagrange point. The masses of the Sun, Earth, and a point located at the Lagrange point are
denoted by 𝑚 1 , 𝑚 2 , and 𝑚 3 , respectively. For the sake of maintaining direction, bodies positioned
to the right will have a positive distance, and vice versa.
It is important to understand what factors are at play when dealing with Lagrange points. What
will be most important is Newton’s Law of Gravitation,

𝐹=

𝐺𝑚 1 𝑚 2
𝑟2

(1)

where F is the force exerted between two bodies of mass, G is the gravitational constant, m is the
mass of a body, and r is the distance between the two bodies. We must also consider the centrifugal
and Coriolis forces acted on the object at the Lagrange point. We can rule out the Coriolis force,
since the collinear Lagrange points will not be moving in our rotating frame of reference. As for
centrifugal force, it will be proportional to the centripetal force,

𝐹 = 𝑚𝜔2𝑟

(2)

where 𝜔 is the angular velocity of the object. Understanding that angular velocity can be defined
as
𝜔=

and the period of a circular orbit, from Kepler’s third law, as

the equation for angular velocity simplifies to

Therefore, the sum of forces acting on an object at a Lagrange point is

Most of the variables are known constants, with r being the only unknown value which represents
the distance of the Lagrange point from 𝑚 1 . It is worth noting that, with respect to direction, 𝑟 2
and (𝑟 − 𝑅) 2 will only reflect acceleration in the negative direction and will not be sufficient to tell
us where L1 and L3 are. To remedy this, the formula is rewritten as such to preserve the sign of 𝑟:

Further simplification of the formula results in a rational function that is almost impossible to solve
by hand. Instead, the roots of the formula are solved for computationally.

Setup Scenarios for Equations of Motion

As stated in the introduction, finding out the motion of a satellite around a Lagrange point will be
incredibly difficult. To prepare for this, lets take a step back and tackle these two scenarios.
For our first scenario, lets imagine that, for some function 𝑛 with respect to 𝑡,
𝑑𝑛
= 4𝑛
𝑑𝑡
In words, the rate of change of the function is equal to itself multiplied by four. Lets say we wanted
to find what function 𝑛 is. While it is not as simple to just integrate this equation, we know that 𝑒 𝑥
is its own derivative. We also know that, because of the chain rule, [𝑒 𝑘𝑥 ] ′ = 𝑘𝑒 𝑘𝑥 . If we substitute
𝑛 for 𝑒 𝑘𝑥 and let 𝑘 = 4, then equation (3) is true. Therefore, we can state the following theorem; for
some equation
𝑑𝑛
= 𝑘𝑛,
𝑑𝑡
𝑛 = 𝑐𝑒 𝑘𝑥

where 𝑐 is some initial constant that cannot be expressed from integrating the derivative. This will
become handy for equations that are only defined by their derivative.
The second scenario builds off the first, and involves equations that are defined by each other.

Consider the following system of equations with functions 𝑥 and 𝑦 in terms of 𝑡:
𝑑𝑥
= 4𝑥 − 2𝑦
𝑑𝑡
𝑑𝑦
= 3𝑥 − 𝑦
𝑑𝑡

𝑥(0) = 4
𝑦(0) = 2

Here, the rate of change of 𝑥 is defined in terms of both 𝑥 and 𝑦, and same goes for the rate of change
of 𝑦. Because these two equations are intertwined, initially it seems impossible to define both 𝑥
and 𝑦 as separate from each other. However, remembering our previous theorem, lets imagine that
it is possible to state the rate of change as function of itself multiplied by a constant, 𝑘.
𝑑𝑥
= 𝑘𝑥 = 4𝑥 − 2𝑦
𝑑𝑡
𝑑𝑦
= 𝑘 𝑦 = 3𝑥 − 𝑦
𝑑𝑡
Forgetting the fact that we are involving derivatives for a moment, we can try solving for 𝑘 by
solving this linear system though substitution.

4𝑥 − 2𝑦 = 𝑘𝑥
(4 − 𝑘)𝑥 = 2𝑦
(4 − 𝑘)𝑥
=𝑦
2
3𝑥 − 𝑦 = 𝑘 𝑦
3𝑥 = (𝑘 + 1)𝑦
3𝑥 = (𝑘 + 1)

(4 − 𝑘)𝑥
2

3 × 2 = (𝑘 + 1)(4 − 𝑘)
0 = (1 + 𝑘)(4 − 𝑘) − 3 × 2

6

By now, we can deduce that there will be two possible values for 𝑘. Continuing the solution,

0 = −𝑘 2 − 3𝑘 + 2
0 = (𝑘 − 1)(𝑘 − 2)

Here, the solutions are 𝑘 1 = 1 and 𝑘 2 = 2. We don’t know what these values mean, however, so lets
see what happens when we plug them into our linear system. For 𝑘 1 :



(1)𝑥 = 4𝑥 − 2𝑦 
=⇒ 2𝑦 = 3𝑥

(1)𝑦 = 3𝑥 − 𝑦 

This gives us a relationship of 𝑥 and 𝑦 where, when 𝑘 = 1, there is a 2 : 3 ratio between 𝑥 and 𝑦.

Deriving Equations of Motion

Deriving the equations of motion to predict the movement of a satellite around a Lagrange point
will be much more difficult. We will need to come up with a coordinate system that we can use
to define our equations of motion around, as well as specific parameters for the physical system to
allow the mathematics to be easier.
Firstly, we must assert that 𝑚 1 ≫ 𝑚 2 ,
ẑ

meaning that the movement of the
Sun due to the gravity of Earth is
ŷ

𝑚 1 (0, 0, 0)
𝜃

negligible. This allows the Sun to

mass of the system. It is also asserted
that 𝑚 2 ≫ 𝑚 3 , so that, similarly to

the previous assertion, the satellite has a negligible effect on Earth. Secondly, continuing with the
conditions from the previous calculations, it is assumed that the Earth is in a circular orbit, making
the system a little easier to comprehend. Thirdly, and unlike the previous calculations, we will
derive the equations of motion from a inertial reference frame, meaning that we will not be viewing
this system from a moving point of reference. This will allow us to completely determine motion
without the need to consider fictitious forces.
As shown in Figure 3, we will have unit vectors x̂, ŷ, and ẑ drawn relative to the orbit of the
Earth. The satellite around L2, 𝑚 3 , will have the coordinates (𝑥3 , 𝑦 3 , 𝑧3 ) represented by the vector
r. Taking from my understanding of vectors, the position of a satellite can be expressed as:

r = 𝑥3 x̂ + 𝑦 3 ŷ + 𝑧 3 ẑ

8

(9)

Because the unit vectors are not actually static in the system (x̂ and ŷ rotate about the origin), their
movement must be taken into account.

x̂ = (cos 𝜃)x̂0 + (sin 𝜃)ŷ0

(10)

ŷ = −(sin 𝜃)x̂0 + (cos 𝜃)ŷ0

(11)

ẑ = ẑ0

(12)

At this point, it is crucial to notice that these equations are not yet useful to us to describe movement.
In order to describe motion, we need to be able to define the velocity and acceleration of the satellite
in three-dimensional space. This means being able to take the derivative of a vector. Let us assert
the following axiom, for some vector v with the basis vectors ı̂ and ȷ̂ components 𝑎 and 𝑏:
𝑑𝑏
𝑑v 𝑑𝑎
=
ı̂ +
ȷ̂
𝑑𝑡
𝑑𝑡
𝑑𝑡

(13)

In other words, the derivative of a vector is the derivative of its components, and would be consistent
with the sum rule for derivatives. The notation here can become quite bloated and difficult to read
if we continue to use Leibniz’s notation. So instead, from here on, we will use Newton’s notation
where possible.
We can take the second derivative of our position vector r:

a=

𝑑 2 r 𝑑 2 𝑥3 x̂ 𝑑 2 𝑦 3 ŷ 𝑑 2 𝑧3 ẑ
=
+
+
𝑑𝑡 2
𝑑𝑡 2
𝑑𝑡 2
𝑑𝑡 2

(14)

Our acceleration vector is then expanded to:

a = 𝑥¥3 x̂ + 𝑦¥ 3 ŷ + 𝑧¥3 ẑ
