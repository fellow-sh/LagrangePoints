Deriving the equations of motion to predict the movement of a satellite around a Lagrange point will be much more difficult than locating the Lagrange points.
We will need to come up with a coordinate system that we can use to define our equations of motion around, as well as specific parameters for the physical system to allow the mathematics to be easier. \par
